// Mini project: create a todo list page. This has two main sections: a <form> and an <ol>. You should do this directly in the HTML.

// The form has three inputs: a text input for the name of the task, a number input for the priority of the task, and a submit. 

// As you create the <li> also create a delete <button> and append it to the <li>. Add an event listener to the <button> where when it's clicked, the <li> will `.remove()` from the page. Be mindful of scope... there are multiple ways to target the  <li> and some are easier than others!

// Add a "delete-all" <button> above the list (you may do this directly in the html). When the button has been clicked, delete all items in the <ol>.
